Can yout tell me a little bit about yourself?:
    I'm a 28 year old web developer, originally from Memphis, TN. In one way or another I ve been a developer since I was a teenager and I have always been a very creative and innovative person. I am fascianted by technology, cryptography, design and the effect technology has on the world around us. As a society, across the globe everyone is becoming more and more connected by the internet and I wanted to be a part of this exciting movement. That is the main reason I decided to head in this direction as a career path. 

What are three of your strengths?:

Loyalty:
 This trait has always come natrually to me because I just like to be that person that other people can be comfortable in relying on. 

Maturity:
 I have been in the workforce for over ten years now. It was very important in my family to start working from a young age so I could have a firm grasp on the job market. What I can bring to the table for HPe is a level of professionalism and real world wisdom you won't be able to find in other interns. 

Patience:
 Learning is a process; I understand that everything I want will not happen over night. I am willing to spend as much time as nessacery to develop the strengthen the skills that are important to my employers and myself. 

Why did you choose to pursue web development? : I had some experience with building websites from an early age, and i knew I really enjoyed it. I went with web development as a career choice because the paths are limitless; I have always gotten great satisfaction from building things and breaking other things down to see how they work. 


Whts aspect of software engineering fascinates you the most?: Devlopment fascinates me the most. I love to see a project come to life from a wireframe to an application, website or program. Its so exctiing to me to take part is that. 

Tell me about your time at general assembly: I learned a LOT. General Assembly is not easy at all. We were encouraged to completely immerse ourselves into a particular subject and it was not unusual to spend two weeks waking up at 6 am and working until close to midnight. General Assembly focused primarily on using JavaScript and Ruby as languages mediums to build full-stack Applications and APIs. 

Describe some of the things you've done at General Assembly; Can you Tell me about the projects you've created? General Assembly bases its curriculum in an AGILE learning environment: we focused primarily on building MERN and MEAN stacks, developing programmatic thinking, and getting ready for the tech industry workforce by working on real-world problems through lab work, homework and projects.
    I have created three projects at general assembly. the frst project was an interactive card game based on blackjack which I deployed onto bit ballon. THe focus was primarily on object orient Programming, design and created for loops that would run through arrays, or use methods like math.random to shuffle cards and deal them to a player. 
        The second project I worked on was a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Handlebars and Node.js). I created a app where a user could submit anonymous confessions to a database. Users could interact with their confessions using CRUD. 
            The third project I worked on was similar to project two, only it had a different front end. I programmed a MERN stack, using React as the front end, instead of handleBars. By this time I had a much more firm grasp on the ins and outs of Express and server creation. React is my favorite front end development tool.  

Why did you choose do go to Georgia State for CIS?:

I picked computer information systems as a major because I want to learn the business side of computer science. Gerogia state has an pretiios businaa school called Robinson which is on of the top in rhe nation
